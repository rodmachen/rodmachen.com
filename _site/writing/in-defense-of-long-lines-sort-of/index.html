  A recently post by <a href="http://www.austinchronicle.com/authors/chase-hoffberger/" target="_blank">Chase Hoffberger</a> at the <a href="http://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/" target="_blank">Austin Chronicle&#8217;s Daily</a> has me thinking a lot about long lines. We live in a city of lines in a culture of lines. We wait <em>in</em> line while people up north wait <em>on</em> line, but regardless of the idiom, we wait. We wait for those things we deem worthy of waiting for from food to phones and anything in between.
</p>

<p>The current reigning champion of most Austin-tacious line is at <a href="https://franklinbarbecue.com/" target="_blank">Franklin Barbeque</a>. This lunch-only joint, widely considered to be the best of it’s kind–in the state, in the country, in the world–has, almost since its inception, had long lines. The best time to go is on a weekday, and even then, I’ d say you’re looking at two to three hours in line before the first bite is swallowed, most of that before the doors even open. I’ve done it. I’ll do it again. The question all of this begs is, “Was it worth it?” Yes, but a qualified yes. It is as worth it as a meal of smoked meat can ever be. Is waiting two or more hours for a plate of deliciousness (and expertise and state pride) worth it? There’s no good answer.<!--more--></p>

<p dir="ltr">
  Some people consider the wait to be a part of the experience. The eating itself takes maybe 30 minutes, but the entire ordeal takes several times that long. I suppose this makes it more memorable, and if waiting in line means hanging out with friends, then all the better.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  For the most part, though, waiting is no fun. My most extreme wait, and one shared by many, was for the iPhone 3G, the first popular iteration of this now ubiquitous piece of technology. I don&#8217;t know why I did it, other than I&#8217;m impatient and really wanted it without having to wait several weeks for it to be resupplied. I arrived at The Domain about an hour before the store opened at 8 a.m., and still waited until after noon to finally buy it. For roughly six hours I waited, and by the time I drove home, I felt beat up. I haven&#8217;t done anything that extreme since.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  My takeaway from this experience may be surprising. Instead of fewer lines, maybe we should have more. We might take it for granted now, but the iPhone is an incredible thing. Truly. Just 20 years ago such a device would be unthinkable. Shouldn&#8217;t we have to do more than just hand over a credit card for the privilege of owning one? What if one had to suffer for luxury and convenience? An iPhone requires standing in line for six hours. A new Mercedes equals a caning. That new house means you lose a finger. Okay, maybe nothing permanent, but these things come to us too easily. There&#8217;s a disconnect between cost and benefit.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  Hoffberger makes the point that those for whom the line at Franklin&#8217;s is too long should simply go to another of the fine BBQ places we have in this city. (<a href="http://www.craftmeats.com/" target="_blank">Micklethwait Craft Meats</a> is my go-to, low-wait favorite. Try to get there when they open at 11.) But there will always be those places that draw a crowd and deservedly so. Just wait until <a href="http://www.shakeshack.com/" target="_blank">Shake Shack</a> opens up on South Lamar later this year. During a trip to New York City a few years ago, I ate there twice in one week, and cannot wait to have it again. Nevermind, yes I can. I will wait. The lines will be stupid, and I&#8217;ll do what I can to minimize it, but at some point I&#8217;ll find myself in that line, jonesing for a burger and fries from the Shack.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  Maybe I&#8217;ll go with friends.
