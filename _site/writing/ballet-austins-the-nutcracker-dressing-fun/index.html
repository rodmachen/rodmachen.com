    <p>Last stop on the Christmas-traditions joyride was <a href="http://www.balletaustin.org/" target="_blank">Ballet Austin’s</a> production of Tchaikovsky’s <a href="http://www.balletaustin.org/atb/nutcracker2013.php" target="_blank">The Nutcracker</a>. Our oldest can now sit through half of a church service, so we figured she was ready for the big time, and when it comes to kids, Christmas and classic music, The Nutcracker is the biggest of times.</p>

<!-- [<img class="alignright  wp-image-138" alt="ballet austin the nutcracker" src="http://words.rodmachen.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ballet-austin-nutcracker-320x256.jpg" width="300" height="240" />] -->
<p>Showing up early was definitely the right thing to do. A Ballet Austin employee hosted a Q&amp;A for kids an hour before showtime, though my little one was too shy to ask anything. Her grandmother let her choose a nutcracker at the gift shop (glittery and purple, naturally) and a couple of oversized, overpriced cookies kept everyone content throughout the performance. <a href="http://thelongcenter.org/" target="_blank">The Long Center</a> is a beautiful venue, and our balcony seats at the front of the top level were perfect for a moderately-close, bird’s-eye view.<!--more--></p>

<p>What stood out most during the people-watching period was how nicely dressed most everyone was. Little kids had their Christmas finery on display, and one young lady walked by with heels apparently made of chopsticks, eliciting semi-scandalous chatter from onlookers. Even the men–usually a bastion of comfort and joylessness–showed off their menswears. In Austin, we pride ourselves on our laid-backness, a West-Coast attribute that often means world-class restaurants are populated with way too many sweatshirts and flip-flops. Ugh. Not here. The audience acquitted itself well, sartorially speaking.</p>

<p>The performance itself was great, especially to this untrained eye. The music was top shelf. Everyone knows these songs, and the people in the pit created a moving accompaniment to the rhythmic movements onstage. Better than a home stereo, I can assure you.</p>

<p>Sometimes we pick our traditions, and sometimes we acquiesce to the popular choice. The Christmas season is full of the later, and The Nutcracker is a fine addition. I’m sure we’ll make it a yearly event. Now I just have to make sure Ballet Austin doesn’t recruit my daughters. (No offense, Ballet Austin, but I’d rather not be a ballet dad.) A fine line indeed.</p>
