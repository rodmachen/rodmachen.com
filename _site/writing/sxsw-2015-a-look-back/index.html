    <p>The South by Southwest “Everything” festival officially kicks off tomorrow, but for many, it’s already here. SXSW badge and swag pick up started today, and for the edu-cated among us, it started Monday. Either way, the next ten days will be a flurry for anyone who steps into Austin’s downtown.</p>

<p>My badge is firmly in hand along with those cool cloth bags that make going to the grocery story another opportunity for hipster cred. As I get ready to help cover the festival for the Austin Chronicle, I want to look back on my history with the event.</p>

<p>It all started in 1998. Spring break brought me to Austin in search of a city to move to after an approaching graduation from Texas A&amp;M. A high-school friend of mine was living here (in the apartments next to the Beverage Barn on Guadalupe) so I had a place to stay. That week introduced me to the Salt Lick and Little City coffee in addition to SXSW, so it was a win all around.</p>

<p>For the previous few months I had been reading the Chronicle which was brought in every week to Marooned, our lone independent record store in College Station. That got me prepped, and after reading about the film festival, I decided to give SXSW a shot. My then-girlfriend/now-wife and I drove down to the Dobie to take in a flick. The ticket sellers convinced me to shell out a whole $35 for a film pass that would get me into numerous films over the course of the week.</p>

<p>For the next several years, the film pass was my entrée to SXSW. A couple of years I got a wristband for music, but film was always my thing. Every year I looked forward to the Chronicle’s publication of the schedule of films. Seeing that multicolored grid was the sweetest of anticipatory delights.</p>

<p>Three years ago, I increased my participation by volunteering for the photo crew. Shooting the interactive and edu festivals got me a badge, that most coveted of festival accoutrement. Moving from the pass line to the badge line only increased my enjoyment of the experience. When I got the opportunity to get a press badge through the Chronicle, it was a no brainer.</p>

<p>While SXSW is certainly a polarizing event for locals, I’m firmly in the pro category. The traffic and nuisance are real, but I love seeing my mid-sized city transformed into the hot spot for hustling and bustling. For one week, it’s New York or LA. Or maybe both. Instead of flying somewhere to be in the thick of things, thousands of people come here instead. What’s not to like?</p>

<p>Now, if I can only find some place to park . . .</p>
