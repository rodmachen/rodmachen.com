After last night’s snafu, I spent today reinstalling everything on my laptop. Everything. 

I let the OS go overnight then spent this evening downloading the programs I use. Then I went back to the ‘Install Day’ page from class and go to work on the dev environment. I figure I’ll be doing this every time I get a new computer, so I better get used to it. I learned a lot more this time about the different pieces of the puzzle. I even ran into some snags, but worked through them. rvm didn’t want to load ruby, so I had to do a forced reinstall. Like everything else, the answers are a Google search away. Also, going to the web page of the different technologies helps.

After that, I finally got to work with Jekyll. Last night, I saw Mae go through the set up and initialization of blog using Jekyll, but tonight, I got to work with it myself. Playing with a new toy is exciting. I know Jekyll isn’t the most complicated of web technologies, but learning to use it from scratch was still a blast. I hope every new technology starts off this way, and with all of the libraries and frameworks JavaScripts keeps spawning, I should have ample opportunity to find out.

I can update through github.com, too.
