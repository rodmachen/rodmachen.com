Hit my first wall this week. Started on Chris Pine&#8217;s &#8216;Learn to Program. The first half of the book went pretty quickly.  It was challenging but completely doable. Chapters 8 & 9 were difficult enough that I had to look far to often at the answers in the back. By chapter 10, I was in over my head. There was a second sorting exercise that I should have been able to attack myself, and I didn&#8217;t even know where to start.

The good news is, I have Plan B. I have started Zed Shaw&#8217;s &#8216;Learn Ruby the Hard Way.&#8221; I completed his command line tutorial, and now I&#8217;m starting on Ruby. It&#8217;s been a little repetitive of the concepts I covered in &#8216;Learn to Program,&#8217; but repetition is good. I have a feeling there are a million ways to teach any language, and I&#8217;m now getting my second way. Once I finish this, I&#8217;ll go back to Pine&#8217;s book. Hopefully, I&#8217;ll be ready for it.

(In between these two resources, I did complete the free tutorial on Code School, but it wasn&#8217;t for me. Too cute, and just didn&#8217;t hit my buttons as a learner. No harm, no foul. It&#8217;s good to know what doesn&#8217;t work for me as well as what does.
