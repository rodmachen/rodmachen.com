  <span style="color: #000000;">Tonight, I began a ten-week class on front-end web development at MakerSquare. After spending the summer learning to code for the first time, I’m not I’m now taking my first organized learning activity on the road to becoming a developer. In less than three months, I should have a firm grasp on creating web sites with HTML and CSS, and some basic JavaScript and jQuery to make them more interactive. From there, the goal is to keep learning JavaScript while completing numerous projects.  </span></p> <div style="color: #000000;">

    The class is being held at MakerSquare’s Congress Avenue location. I’ve been there a few times for interviews and meet ups, so I was ready for the utilitarian, exposed-brick environment. I had made a point of meeting two of the instructors, Elyse and Flip previously, but this was my first time to be their student.

    I knew the first week would be a little slow as we ramped up, and while I thought I wouldn’t like that, it turned out to be great. On the first night, expectations for the class were laid out, and we all introduced ourselves. I’m probably the oldest, and the backgrounds varied widely among the 20 students. Surprisingly, I already had connects with a handful of them, having mutual friends and experiences. The funniest moment was when Bob said he went to A&M but wasn’t “a real Aggie.” We met afterward, and I said I was definitely a real Aggie, and we shared some stories. Elyse told me to hook ‘em, but I don’t hold that against her.

    The textbook is HTML & CSS by Jon Duckett, the same book I read this summer. I’m glad to know I was on the right track. I now have two copies, so I can share the wealth with an up-and-comer I meet in the future.

    I’m optimistic about this class. I know I’ll learn a lot, and I also know it’ll be up to me to push myself to get everything out of this experience that I can. The instructors, including Mae and Alex, will be an amazing resource. They’re willing to meet off hours for extra help, and I definitely see myself taking advantage of that.
