title: Responsive Web Design and Foundation
<!-- categories: front-end class -->
---
Tonight was the first time I have actually prepped for class. Usually, I’m lucky to show up with a working brain, but I had a little more time this weekend than usual.

Some of that prep was completing old homework. I knew we were starting on [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/ "Zurb Foundation") tonight, so I figured I should finally finish my CSS grid assignment. I got stuck, but luckily Clare helped me out before class in finishing it up. Glad she did, because a lot of that came into play as the night went on.

Like any good obsessive, I spent a ton of time Googling information not only about Foundation, but also frameworks in general. I now know the name of a half dozen different ways to make a gridded web site. One in particular, [Gumby](http://gumbyframework.com/ "Gumby"), has me intrigued. I might have to play with it after class is over. For now, Foundation.

We started class by talking about responsive web design. I knew the basics, but it was good to hear the details of how to go about making such a site, especially the “mobile first” mantra. It gave me a lot to think about for my final project.

We then downloaded Foundation and got it set up. From there, we finished it out with work on the newspaper project. Easily the homework assignment I’m most looking forward to. I think I’ll have a good grasp of Foundation basics after this. 

Mae didn’t want to go with the Sass version, and that’s probably best at this point. However, I know I’m going to learn it at some point. I’m convinced that I want to be proficient in building web sites, and using pre-existing tools is going to be a part of that. I don’t need to build from scratch when I can get 90% of the value out of these frameworks and libraries. Where I want to put my energy is into learning languages and programming fundamentals. This stuff is just to baseline of knowledge about front-end site creation.
