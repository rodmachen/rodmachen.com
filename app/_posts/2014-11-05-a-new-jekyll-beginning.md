title: A New Jekyll Beginning
---

After using Jekyll for this blog over the last month–having been introduced to it in my MakerSquare class–I've found a new way to use it: Prose.

[Prose](http://prose.io) is an online editor for use with Github. It's especially good with Jekyll, and that's how I'll use using it. I was content to use my text editor and command line interface, but if this project is going to proceed into the future, the easier the better. When I'm at work, I have a laptop that isn't set up with my development environment, and being able to create and alter posts online will be extremely useful. 

Getting started with Prose wasn't easy. Or at least, it wasn't as easy as I thought it would be. As always, reading the directions helps. When I first logged in, I was able to go to my blog repo and create a post. However, it gave me problems when trying to publish. After doing a little research, I found out that I needed to have established some Prose settings in my config.yml file. There are a ton of options laid out [here](https://github.com/prose/prose/wiki/Prose-Configuration). I designated which repo I always wanted to  start with and what layout I would use. The title had been formed by the file name, but I reversed that. I also set it to publish automatically unless I unchecked the appropriate box. 

I now have an online editor that will let me create posts in markdown and commit them directly to my blog's repo. Within a few seconds, they appear on the blog itself. Works for me.
