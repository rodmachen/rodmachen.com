<a href="http://www.sho.com/sho/dexter/home" target="_blank">Dexter</a> might have had its moments as a television show, but it was never confused for a top-shelf parenting manual. However, not only did it share a brilliant piece of parental advice, but it came from a most unlikely of characters: the Trinity Killer. John Lithgow&#8217;s mass murderer might have had his problems (most of which Dexter Morgan solved for him), but he did have a pretty viable facade of domestic bliss, and heck, other than the abusive outbursts, he was probably a pretty decent dad.

Year after year they will become more and more meaningful. Now that I have two little ones under four, we&#8217;re executing on a lot more of these traditions, and this was the year for the <a href="http://austintrailoflights.org" target="_blank">Trail of Lights</a> at Zilker Park. This 15-day extravaganza was reborn a few years ago with corporate sponsors, and wouldn&#8217;t you know it, a way to skip all the lines. It&#8217;s a very popular event, and like everything in this town, the lines are Austin-tacious.<!--more-->

The key to said line-skippage? Money. Specifically $15 per adult (plus parking) to get into the event 45 minutes early. Sign me up! A special area to eat as well as decent bathrooms were also a part of the deal. The trip down was enough of a traffic-y adventure that we only got in 30 minutes in advance, but even then, we saw an enormous line of people waiting in line for display after display of sponsored, light-engulfed goodness. That was the moment I realized my privilege. If I had walked up to that line, I would have turned right back around and went home. After a corn dog, of course. This is really two different events: one for those that can afford to cut in line, and those that will wait. Once in, the latter group will jostle for position, trying to get their little ones a view of all the pretty lights.

This is nothing new. VIP options abound for events of all kinds. Even our main westside highway will soon have an <a href="http://www.mopacexpress.com/express-lanes/index.php" target="_blank">express lane</a> with escalating tolls to help those of us who live north to get downtown without all the *bother* of sitting in traffic. I&#8217;m lucky enough to be able to afford these things, and if I wasn&#8217;t, I&#8217;d be on the other side of the velvet rope. I wonder if I&#8217;d look at other-me with disdain?

Next up: <a href="http://www.balletaustin.org/atb/nutcracker2013.php" target="_blank">The Nutcracker</a> at the Long Center. See you there! Or not.
