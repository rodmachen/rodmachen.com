Last week, I did something I rarely do anymore: went out to see live music. In fact, I did something even more rare: I saw music two nights in a row. What am I, twenty? (Try double that.) What got this old(ish) man out of the house? A band that hasn&#8217;t toured or released new music since the second Clinton administration.

<!-- <img class="alignright size-full wp-image-415" alt="Neutral Milk Hotel Two" src="http://words.rodmachen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/NHM-Two.jpg" width="300" height="300" /><a href="http://www.walkingwallofwords.com/" target="_blank">Neutral Milk Hotel</a>  -->is the definition of a cult favorite. Favorite because to many people, *In the Aeroplane over the Sea* is the best album of the 90s if not all time. Cult because the man behind the band, Jeff Mangum, turned semi-recluse right at the height of their limited fame. (Although evidentally, if you lived in Athens, GA, you could easily see him around town.)

This fame has only grown, not because of this interesting back story, but because the music holds up. It&#8217;s truly amazing. My first encounter was hearing a rendition of the opening track from *Aeroplane*, &#8220;The King of Carrot Flowers, Part 1&#8243; sung by my friend Chris while sitting on the bed of our friend Jason. There&#8217;s a reason it was put at the beginning of the album; it&#8217;s catchy and catching.<!--more-->

Before long I had the album, and I like it as much now as I did 15 years ago. Problem is, I got on board a few months too late. The band had release their final album and performed what looked like their final tour. The last decade has been filled with fans wondering about Mangum&#8217;s absence. &#8220;I wonder what&#8217;s going on with him?&#8221; &#8220;Surely, he&#8217;s writing music still.&#8221; &#8220;He he ever going to release a new album?&#8221;

A couple of years ago, the dam broke. Mangum did a solo tour, performing the songs of Neutral Milk Hotel. Fortunately, he brought some fellow band members, and the show I saw at <a href="http://acl-live.com/" target="_blank">ACL Live</a> was amazing. This time around, the full band was present, and they played two nights at the same venue. The first night, I went with friends at sat at the front of the balcony. The second night I had a ticket for the floor and pulled a superfan maneuver, getting there early for a place right up front.

Mangum still brings it and sings without a hint of irony, something that would kill these songs. The crowd ate it up, and the energy stayed high all night, even during the more extended, noisy parts of the performance.

It seems like Mangum and Co. could do this once every few years and both give his audience a treat while making a little scratch. We&#8217;ll see what happens, but for me and my aging body, this might be the only cool thing that gets me out of the house.

(Photographic apologies to the band: They requested no photography, but one of my seatmates captured the above photo. Sorry. Had to use it.)

Bonus section: If Neutral Milk Hotel has never crossed your sonic palette, here&#8217;s a three-course tasting menu that will help you decide whether future exploration is necessary. (Available in all the normal places.)

&#8220;The King of Carrot Flowers, Part 1&#8243; – A solo acoustic number that will have you swaying back and forth to angsty, heartfelt lyrics. If this does nothing for you, end this excursion here.

&#8220;Holland, 1945&#8243; – An upbeat number with speed and noise to spare while still grabbing hold of the listener down deep. This song also gives a taste of one of the inspirations for the album: The Diary of Anne Frank. Mangum read that book and really felt it. *Really* felt it.

&#8220;Oh, Comely&#8221; – If you&#8217;ve come this far, then this song will make it or break it. Clocking in at over eight minutes, this track is epic. More Anne Frank. More acoustic guiter. More horns. More everything!
