title: Animal Project and Halfway Done
<!-- categories: front-end class -->
---
Tonight was very much “hands on.” For most of the evening with worked in small groups trying so solve a series of problems.

We went through a project--involving dogs, cats, and monkeys--that used jQuery for sorting and other manipulations of the DOM. We also played with some plug-ins that do cool things with images. The main project was something that had been a part of the pre-work, so while it was familiar, I still had to start from scratch in solving the problems. That has happened to me before, and it’s always a learning experience. I don’t know any of this well enough to sit down and bust through it, even if I have done it before. Each time it gets easier, though, so there’s something to be said for repetition. 

With the conclusion of tonight's class, the front-end course if halfway finished. That's got me thinking. In one way, time flew by. I've gotten to know several people in the class, and we've covered a decent bit of ground: basic HTML; CSS floats, grids, etc.; dev inspector; JavaScript fundamentals; jQuery selectors and methods; a little JSON; Jekyll and templating; and tons of git. I'm probably not alone in this, but I certainly haven't finished every homework assignment--the CSS grid exercise comes to mind. I hope to put more outside time into the class from now till the end.
