As I’ve gotten into software development, people come up to me with surprising regularity expressing a desire to learn to code. Some of them already have a complementary skill like design, but others are just ready to jump in. This article is about the very first steps one should take to get set up, and then start creating.

If web development is the goal, then the eternal mantra should be Chris Coyier’s dictum, [“Just Build Web Sites.”](https://css-tricks.com/just-build-websites/) It's the old maxim of "learn by doing" repurposed for the digital age. The key technologies that comprise any website are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# HTML

This is the structure of the page. At its most basic, that means the content, but it also provides the most-basic basic description of what goes where, and how elements on a page are related to each other. Think about the normal layout pattern of header, main section, side bar, and footer. Each of these has pieces of content like text, links, and images, and they are enveloped in other elements to group them. HTML does all of this. 

# CSS

This is the styling of the page. Think of the formatting bar in a word processor. A piece of text exists on its own, but can be made larger, smaller, bold, italic. This is just the beginning of what CSS can do. It can position elements on the page, or even deal with fancy animation. Warning: CSS has its own rules, and while like HTML it isn’t a programming language per se, there’s lots to learn, and it’s not always straightforward.

# JavaScript

This is what makes websites go. Any bit of interactivity or advanced features, probably comes from JavaScript. Because it’s a full-fledge programming language (and can be used for much more than just what we call websites), learning JavaScript can take a long, long time. Fortunately, you can start small and big. There are even libraries and frameworks that help you do big things with just a little know-how, the most popular of these being jQuery. Bottom line: If you’re into design, give this a lower initial priority. For doing true software engineering, this is where you want to live.

#Tools

***Browser***

This is something everyone has, but for web development, make sure you’re using Chrome. Others can work, and in a few years, Chrome might not be the first choice, but for now it is. It has build in features (like Dev Tools) that you’ll eventually use, so go ahead and start with it.

***Sublime Text***

The number one tool for any coder is a text editor. While there are lots of options, Sublime Text is the most popular of the user-friendly models. Get [the newest version](https://www.sublimetext.com/3), and use it for free as long as you’d like. Use it to open up entire folders of files to see the structure, and do all of your coding inside this piece of software. 

***Terminal***

While some part of web development have a graphical interface, please use the terminal as often as you can. (This is the Mac name for it; others may vary.) The terminal gives you access to the command line, and at the lowest level gives you access to your files and folders. This is just the tip of the iceberg. All of the parts of development that don’t have to do with typing the actual code will happen here. Get used to it, and get good at it. For Mac users, look into [iTerm 2](https://www.iterm2.com/) instead of the built in terminal.

***GitHub***

This is kind of an advanced technique, but it’s going to be so central to everything you do that it might as well get introduced early. [GitHub](https://github.com/) is a free service that give you easy access to the Git software package. At its most simple, this gives you the ability to keep track of the changes you make to you files and even “undo” to recover older versions when needed. More importantly, it allows multiple people to work on the same project without descending into chaos. It’s complicated, hard to learn, but nothing short of essential. Start looking into it now. Make an account, and start playing around.

# Extras and Advice

Start blogging, tweeting, and meeting people. These three soft skills will go a long way in your development as a developer. For blogging, look into the Jekyll/GitHub Pages solution. With Twitter, find good people to follow, and keep up with the latest news and conversation. As far as meeting people, nothing beats a meetup. Learn a little something, and shakes some hands. People are universally excited to share what they know when you show you’re excited about their field. Then go home and follow them on twitter. And even blog about it!

# Resources

[Learn to Code HTML & CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/): The best resource I've found for putting it all together. 

[Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/): There are tons of online learning options, but Codecademy is good and free. Try out the HTML & CSS, jQuery, JavaScript, Command Line, and Git courses. 

[The Command Line Crash Course](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/): A great way to get familiar with the command line.

[Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) & [Up and Going](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/tree/master/up%20%26%20going): These two are waiting for you when you're ready to dive into JavaScript, with the latter being a gentle introduction, and the former a friendly but comprehensive look. 

[CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/): You'll find yourself going back here time and time again to find out how to do that "one little thing" you can't quite figure out. Indispensable. Most Google searches will take you there, but it's good to look around inside as well.
